The app was built using Python3 and OpenCV. An algorithm that reads and recognizes a given QR Code was developed, relating each one of them to an unique storaged object. The app then returns an image of the object's sector with his location marked by a bouding box.

The video above show some of the code functions. Like a photo being taken by a webcam and, because there was a QR Code with data equals to 1, it returned the image of where the object should be. Also a dropdown with some of the registred itens. 

The code was implemented into an .apk app, being designed to work with Android. 



# Prerequisites
We used a notebook with Linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and 18.04 LTS, others versions and operating systems were not tested. We also used an android device for the whole project.

## Python 3.7 
Python 3.7 was used for the project

## Anaconda 3.8.0
We kept the environments organized with anaconda 3.8.0. More info [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

## OpenCV 4.1.2
OpenCV was used to analise and manipulate images.

## Openpyxl



# Installation
## Prepare Conda:
Install anaconda. Downloading and installing varies on some operating systems. Read the official guide to install [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
Create an environment with python 3.7:

	conda create -n [repository name] python==3.7.0
	
Then activate it:

	conda activate [repository name]
	

## Install all libraries:

[OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/):

	pip install opencv-python	

[Numpy](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy):

	conda install -c anaconda numpy

[Openpyxl](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/openpyxl):

	conda install -c anaconda openpyxl

[Pyzbar](https://anaconda.org/lightsource2-tag/pyzbar):

	conda install -c lightsource2-tag pyzbar
	

# Test it 
Clone this repository:

	git clone https://github.com/ArturStarling/QR-Organizer
	
Execute *main.py*:
	
	pyhton main.py
	
On the QrCode reader function, use an Qrcode generated by the number 1 or 2

# Test it on your android device:
1. Download the apk on your android device
2. Create and print QR codes with numeration, for example 1 to 10.

With that, you can already recognize some QR codes and return some example images.
